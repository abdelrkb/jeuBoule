# BallGame

Ball game is a project I had to code for school, it consists of a game with 2 players that place a ball on the board.
Whenre you place a ball you gain surface on the board, the player who has the most surface at the end of the game wins !

To spice up the game, you can pass your turn and choose to divide one of the other player ball, there are a lot of options you can activate to makes the game funnier !
